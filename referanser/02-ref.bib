  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Regression analysis quantifies the relationships
               between one or more independent variables and a dependent
               variable and is one of the most frequently used types of
               analysis in medical research. The aim of this article is to
               provide a brief theoretical and practical tutorial for
               neurosurgeons wishing to conduct or interpret regression
               analyses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data preparation, univariable and
               multivariable analysis, choice of model, model requirements and
               assumptions are discussed, as essential prerequisites to any
               regression analysis. Four main types of regression techniques
               are presented: linear, logistic, multinomial logistic, and
               proportional odds logistic. To illustrate the applications of
               regression to real-world data and exemplify the concepts
               introduced, we used a previously reported data set of patients
               with intracranial aneurysms treated by microsurgical clip
               reconstruction at the Department of Neurosurgery of Erasmus MC
               University Medical Center Rotterdam, between January 2000 and
               January 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Regression analysis is a powerful and
               versatile instrument in data analysis. This material is intended
               as a starter for those wishing to critically interpret or
               perform regression analysis and we recommend multidisciplinary
               collaborations with trained methodologists, statisticians, or
               epidemiologists.",

@ARTICLE{Antonutto,
  title    = "The concept of lactate threshold. A short review",
  author   = "Antonutto, G and Di Prampero, P E",
  abstract = "The anaerobic threshold (AT) is a widely used tool for
              investigating aerobic performance characteristics in
              physiological of pathological conditions. The aim of the present
              paper is to show that, when the lactate concentration in blood
              [Lab] is constant in time, regardless of its absolute level, the
              whole body energy sources for muscular work are entirely aerobic.
              In fact, [Lab] can remain constant if, and only if, La production
              is equal to La removal. Since this last is an entirely aerobic
              process, it can be shown that the net anaerobic energy yield from
              La production is nil, even if some muscle fibres are indeed
              producing La at a non trivial rate. These conditions will be
              defined as ``unevenly aerobic'' to distinguish them from: (1) the
              traditional ``evenly aerobic'' ones, in which the net La
              production is also zero, but because neither La production nor La
              removal are significantly increased, and (2) ``true anaerobic''
              conditions wherein La production exceeds La removal and therefore
              [Lab] increases continuously in time. Comparison of unevenly
              versus evenly aerobic conditions shows that in the former case
              the depletion of the glycogen stores is faster in the muscles (or
              muscle fibres) that are producing La than in those which remove
              it. Hence the La producing fibres may become crucial in setting
              the duration (or intensity) of performance. AT, irrespective of
              its precise mode of assessment, is presumably a measure of the
              exercise intensity corresponding (or close) to the transition
              between evenly and unevenly aerobic conditions, thus explaining
              why AT is a good estimate of the subjects' training status and/or
              performance capacity.",

               most important polymorphisms associated with athletic
               performance. This single-nucleotide mutation leads to a
               premature stop codon, resulting in a nonfunctional protein
               product. The presence of the dominant R allele is associated
               with full power skeletal muscle contraction. Homozygosity for
               the X allele is correlated with more efficient energy disposure.
               Restriction fragment length polymorphism and real-time
               polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the standard methods used to
               genotype this polymorphism, but they are expensive and require
               special equipments. Here, we present a simple and cost-efficient
               method to genotype the ACTN3 r577x polymorphism by a single PCR.
               External primers yield a 690-bp product that indicates the
               template quality. Internal primers produce a 413-bp product if
               the R allele is present and a 318-bp product if the X allele is
               present. Our four-primer genotyping PCR was validated by the
               standard real-time PCR, generally used to genotype this
               single-nucleotide polymorphism, demonstrating the accuracy of
               this method. This protocol is perfect for small- or large-scale

               biomarkers between previously-trained low versus high
               hypertrophic responders in response to resistance training.
               Herein, 30 college-aged males (training age 5 $\pm$ 3 years;
               mean $\pm$ SD) partook in 6 weeks of high-volume resistance
               training. Body composition, right leg vastus lateralis (VL)
               biopsies, and blood were obtained prior to training (PRE) and at
               the 3-week (W3) and 6-week time points (W6). The 10 lowest (LOW)
               and 10 highest (HIGH) hypertrophic responders were clustered
               based upon a composite hypertrophy score of PRE-to-W6 changes in
               right leg VL mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), VL
               thickness assessed via ultrasound, upper right leg lean soft
               tissue mass assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and
               mid-thigh circumference. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare
               biomarker differences between the LOW and HIGH clusters over
               time, and stepwise linear regression was performed to elucidate
               biomarkers that explained significant variation in the composite
               hypertrophy score from PRE to W3, W3 to W6, and PRE to W6 in all
               30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a
               composite hypertrophy change of +10.7 $\pm$ 3.2 and -2.1 $\pm$
               1.6\%, respectively (p W3 > PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE >
               W3\&W6), pan-mTOR (PRE > W3 W3 W3 W3), muscle ubiquitin-labeled
               proteins (PRE > W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6 > W3\&PRE),
               45S rRNA (PRE > W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE >
               W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned
               biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome
               activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor
               protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase).
               Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R 2
               = 0.152, $\beta$ = 0.390, p = 0.033) and PRE type II fCSA (R 2 =
               0.207, $\beta$ = -0.455, p = 0.019) best predicted the PRE-to-W6
               change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size
               is limited, these data suggest: (a) HIGH responders may exhibit
               more growth potential given that they possessed lower PRE type
               II fCSA values and (b) possessing a greater type II fiber
               percentage as a trained individual may be advantageous for
               hypertrophy in response to resistance training.",
