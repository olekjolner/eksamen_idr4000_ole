  abstract = "Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental
              failure even when all other experimental considerations have been
              addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number
              of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations
              (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can
              decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been
              clearly addressed yet remains controversial-especially in regards
              to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for
              between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and
              brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power
              problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of
              such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects
              and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows
              that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample
              sizes (n = 20-30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly
              represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large
              variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the
              Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much
              more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the
              extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions
              to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using
              less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest.
              However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have
              major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help
              address the power problem include model-based (multivariate)
              prediction methods and meta-analyses with related
              synthesis-oriented approaches.",

  author    = "Lakens, Dani{\"e}l",
  abstract  = "Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical
               studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their
               importance to communicate the practical significance of results.
               For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because
               they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to
               determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining
               effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical
               primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests
               and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power
               analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect
               sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address
               within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed
               overview of the similarities and differences between within- and
               between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions
               in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual
               effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the
               correlation between measures the best summary of the results.
               Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as
               easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size
               calculations into their workflow.",
