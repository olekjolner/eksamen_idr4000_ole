  abstract  = "Scientists are often steered by common convention, funding
               agencies, and journal guidelines into a hypothesis-driven
               experimental framework, despite Isaac Newton's dictum that
               hypotheses have no place in experimental science. Some may think
               that Newton's cautionary note, which was in keeping with an
               experimental approach espoused by Francis Bacon, is inapplicable
               to current experimental method since, in accord with the
               philosopher Karl Popper, modern-day hypotheses are framed to
               serve as instruments of falsification, as opposed to
               verification. But Popper's ``critical rationalist'' framework
               too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent
               on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern ``large
               science,'' such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual
               goals of experimental science, which is verification and not
               falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a
               practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework
               for experimentation is offered. Presented is an alternative
               framework-the query/model approach-which many scientists may
               discover is the framework they are actually using, despite being
               required to give lip service to the hypothesis.",

    abstract = "{This article is concerned with Bayesian epistemology. Bayesianism claims to provide a unified theory of epistemic and practical rationality based on the principle of mathematical expectation. In its epistemic guise, it requires believers to obey the laws of probability. In its practical guise, it asks agents to maximize their subjective expected utility. This article explains the five pillars of Bayesian epistemology, each of which claims and evaluates some of the justifications that have been offered for them. It also addresses some common objections to Bayesianism, in particular the “problem of old evidence” and the complaint that the view degenerates into an untenable subjectivism. It closes by painting a picture of Bayesianism as an “internalist” theory of reasons for action and belief that can be fruitfully augmented with “externalist” principles of practical and epistemic rationality.}",
