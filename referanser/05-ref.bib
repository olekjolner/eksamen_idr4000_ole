  abstract  = "Inactive adults experience a 3\% to 8\% loss of muscle mass per
               decade, accompanied by resting metabolic rate reduction and fat
               accumulation. Ten weeks of resistance training may increase lean
               weight by 1.4 kg, increase resting metabolic rate by 7\%, and
               reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg. Benefits of resistance training
               include improved physical performance, movement control, walking
               speed, functional independence, cognitive abilities, and
               self-esteem. Resistance training may assist prevention and
               management of type 2 diabetes by decreasing visceral fat,
               reducing HbA1c, increasing the density of glucose transporter
               type 4, and improving insulin sensitivity. Resistance training
               may enhance cardiovascular health, by reducing resting blood
               pressure, decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
               triglycerides, and increasing high-density lipoprotein
               cholesterol. Resistance training may promote bone development,
               with studies showing 1\% to 3\% increase in bone mineral
               density. Resistance training may be effective for reducing low
               back pain and easing discomfort associated with arthritis and
               fibromyalgia and has been shown to reverse specific aging
               factors in skeletal muscle.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The optimal prescription and precise recommendations
              of resistance training volume for older adults is unclear in the
              current literature. In addition, the interactions between
              resistance training volume and program duration as well as
              physical health status remain to be determined when assessing
              physical function, muscle size and hypertrophy and muscle
              strength adaptations in older adults. OBJECTIVES: This study
              aimed to determine which resistance training volume is the most
              effective in improving physical function, lean body mass,
              lower-limb muscle hypertrophy and strength in older adults.
              Additionally, we examined whether effects were moderated by
              intervention duration (i.e. short term, < 20 weeks;
              medium-to-long term, $\geq$ 20 weeks) and physical health status
              (i.e. physically healthy, physically impaired, mixed physically
              healthy and physically impaired; PROSPERO identifier:
              CRD42023413209). METHODS: CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Scielo,
              SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases were searched up to
              April 2023. Eligible randomised trials examined the effects of
              supervised resistance training in older adults (i.e. $\geq$ 60
              years). Resistance training programs were categorised as low
              (LVRT), moderate (MVRT) and high volume (HVRT) on the basis of
              terciles of prescribed weekly resistance training volume (i.e.
              product of frequency, number of exercises and number of sets) for
              full- and lower-body training. The primary outcomes for this
              review were physical function measured by fast walking speed,
              timed up and go and 6-min walking tests; lean body mass and
              lower-body muscle hypertrophy; and lower-body muscle strength
              measured by knee extension and leg press one-repetition maximum
              (1-RM), isometric muscle strength and isokinetic torque. A
              random-effects network meta-analysis was undertaken to examine
              the effects of different resistance training volumes on the
              outcomes of interest. RESULTS: We included a total of 161
              articles describing 151 trials (n = 6306). LVRT was the most
              effective for improving timed up and go [- 1.20 standardised mean
              difference (SMD), 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): - 1.57 to -
              0.82], 6-min walk test (1.03 SMD, 95\% CI: 0.33-1.73), lean body
              mass (0.25 SMD, 95\% CI: 0.10-0.40) and muscle hypertrophy (0.40
              SMD, 95\% CI: 0.25-0.54). Both MVRT and HVRT were the most
              effective for improving lower-limb strength, while only HVRT was
              effective in increasing fast walking speed (0.40 SMD, 95\% CI: -
              0.57 to 0.14). Regarding the moderators, our results were
              independent of program duration and mainly observed for healthy
              older adults, while evidence was limited for those who were
              physically impaired. CONCLUSIONS: A low resistance training
              volume can substantially improve healthy older adults' physical
              function and benefits lean mass and muscle size independently of
              program duration, while a higher volume seems to be necessary for
              achieving greater improvements in muscle strength. A low volume
              of resistance training should be recommended in future exercise
              guidelines, particularly for physically healthy older adults
              targeting healthy ageing.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Understanding which factors influence participation
              in physical activity is important to improve the public health.
              The aim of the present review of reviews was to summarize and
              present updated evidence on personal and environmental factors
              associated with physical activity. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE
              were searched for reviews published up to 31 Jan. 2017 reporting
              on potential factors of physical activity in adults aged over 18
              years. The quality of each review was appraised with the
              Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews
              (AMSTAR) checklist. The corrected covered area (CCA) was
              calculated as a measure of overlap for the primary publications
              in each review. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles met the inclusion
              criteria which reviewed 90 personal and 27 environmental factors.
              The average quality of the studies was moderate, and the CCA
              ranged from 0 to 4.3\%. For personal factors, self-efficacy was
              shown as the strongest factor for participation in physical
              activity (7 out of 9). Intention to exercise, outcome
              expectation, perceived behavioral control and perceived fitness
              were positively associated with physical activity in more than 3
              reviews, while age and bad status of health or fitness were
              negatively associated with participation in physical activity in
              more than 3 reviews. For environmental factors, accessibility to
              facilities, presence of sidewalks, and aesthetics were positively
              associated with participation in physical activity. CONCLUSIONS:
              The findings of this review of reviews suggest that some personal
              and environmental factors were related with participation in
              physical activity. However, an association of various factors
              with physical activity could not be established because of the
              lack of primary studies to build up the organized evidence. More
              studies with a prospective design should be conducted to
              understand the potential causes for physical activity.",
