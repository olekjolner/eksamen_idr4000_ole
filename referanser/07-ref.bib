  abstract  = "Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is considered
               today as the gold standard for accurate, sensitive and fast
               measurement of gene expression. Unfortunately, what many users
               fail to appreciate is that numerous critical issues in the
               workflow need to be addressed before biologically meaningful and
               trustworthy conclusions can be drawn. Here, we review the entire
               workflow from the planning and preparation phase, over the
               actual real-time PCR cycling experiments to data-analysis and
               reporting steps. This process can be captured with the
               appropriate acronym PCR: plan/prepare, cycle and report. The key
               message is that quality assurance and quality control are
               essential throughout the entire RT-qPCR workflow; from living
               cells, over extraction of nucleic acids, storage, various
               enzymatic steps such as DNase treatment, reverse transcription
               and PCR amplification, to data-analysis and finally reporting.",
